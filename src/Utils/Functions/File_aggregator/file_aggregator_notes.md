I'll help create a detailed technical brief for the File Aggregator tool. Let me break this down into a comprehensive plan.

Technical Brief: File Aggregator Tool
Overview
A utility tool that aggregates code files based on a YAML configuration, converting them into a semantically formatted markdown document for easy sharing with AI coding assistants.

Core Requirements Analysis
Input
YAML configuration file containing:
File paths (direct file references)
Directory paths (for recursive file collection)
Optional file/directory exclusion patterns
Optional file type filters
Processing
Configuration Parsing
Parse YAML config using Pydantic models
Validate paths and patterns
Support both absolute and relative paths
File Collection
Recursive directory traversal
File filtering based on extensions
Handle symlinks and permissions safely
Skip binary files and non-code files
Content Processing
Language detection based on file extensions
UTF-8 encoding handling
Line ending normalization
Size limit checks
Output
Single markdown file containing:
File metadata headers (path, language, type)
Code blocks with appropriate language tags
Hierarchical structure matching source
Table of contents for navigation
Technical Architecture
Components
Config Handler
Code
CopyInsert
# Example config.yaml
include:
  files:
    - src/main.py
    - config/settings.yaml
  directories:
    - src/utils/
    - src/models/
exclude:
  patterns:
    - "*.pyc"
    - "__pycache__"
    - ".git"
File Collector
Path resolution and validation
Directory walking with filtering
File metadata extraction
Content Processor
Language detection
Content sanitization
Markdown formatting
Output Generator
Template-based markdown generation
Table of contents creation
File organization
Implementation Strategy
Phase 1: Core Framework
Config parsing and validation
Basic file collection
Simple markdown generation
Phase 2: Enhanced Features
Language detection
Exclusion patterns
Size limits and warnings
Phase 3: Output Optimization
Table of contents
Hierarchical organization
Cross-referencing
Technical Considerations
Performance
Lazy loading for large files
Stream processing for output generation
Memory efficient directory traversal
Error Handling
Graceful handling of missing files
Clear error messages for config issues
Logging of skipped files/directories
Extensibility
Pluggable language detectors
Custom markdown formatters
Configurable output templates
Would you like me to proceed with implementing this plan? I can start with creating the basic structure and core components. Also, please let me know if you'd like to adjust any aspects of this technical brief before we begin.
